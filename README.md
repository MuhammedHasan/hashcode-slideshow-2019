# Hashcode 2019: How to go grand final?

Unexperienced hashcode participates thinks that top team uses some complicated magic optimization algorithms (genetics algorithm, SAP solvers, ...) but this is not true as far as I know. Top-ranked teams just use better heuristics than others. In this repo,  although I cannot get into the top 50 in the online section, I provide a simple algorithm which is implementable and runnable in 4-hour time frame and can get rank you in the top 50.
